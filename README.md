If you see this error:
```
error acting as staker                   
err="error advancing stake from node 2 (hash 0xee288c5dcc61206e6868fa7a01da6abaabe22d6c849718a47eb361857b7e8dd8): error generating node action: block validation is still pending"
```
This error is expected when running a newly deployed rollup with no recent activity. It occurs because there are no new nodes to stake on or no new batches have been posted. Simply let the system continue running.
